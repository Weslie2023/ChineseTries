# ChineseTries

This project is for course 593 about topics Tree or Hashmap based dictionary for other languages

A trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of data, particularly for strings. When applied to Chinese words, a trie can be used to store and search Chinese text in a compact and efficient manner. Here's a description of a project that uses tries to work with Chinese words:

Project: Chinese Words Trie

Objective: To create an efficient data structure for storing and searching Chinese words using a trie.

## Instruction
To properly execute the code in this repository, please follow the guidelines below:

- There are three folders in the ```src``` folder: ```ShuangpinTrie```, ```chineseTrie``` and ```chineseTrieTest```

- ```ShuangpinTrie``` includes ChineseTrie and ShuangpinTrie and their performance test.

- If you want to explore and test the functionality of the data structure, run the ```ShuangPinTrie.java``` file in the ```ShuangpinTrie``` folder. This file contains the main code for the ShuangpinTrie data structure.

- If you are interested in testing the performance of the ShuangpinTrie, execute the ```ShuangPinTriePerformanceTest.java``` file in the ```ShuangpinTrie``` folder. This test class is specifically designed to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the data structure under various scenarios.

- For experimentation and testing of the ChineseTrie, run the ```ChineseTrie.java``` file in the ```ShuangpinTrie``` folder. This class provides an implementation of the ChineseTrie data structure.

Please refer to the project documentation or consult the project's README file for any additional instructions or requirements specific to this repository.
